# Portfolio Project

Welcome! This is my portfolio 2025, built with the Shadcn UI library and i18next for multilanguage support.
This portfolio is in a constant working in progress and showcase of my skills and projects as web developer and UXUI designer. You can navigate through the different sections to learn more about me and my work.
